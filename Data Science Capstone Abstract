# We are a team of Data Science majors at the College of Charleston, and for our final semester project, we contributed to Pandas
Pandas is an open source software library written for Python that helps simplify data structures and data analysis. 
It is one of the most popular libraries for data manipulation and is widely used in the field of Data Science. 
The main theme surrounding our project is to provide Pandas with information they can reflect on their website. 
The Pandas website has very little information about what someone can do using their package. 
Our goal was to provide information and visualizations about the big ideas surroundings what Pandas can do and how people 
in the business and academic world can use it to benefit their project.
